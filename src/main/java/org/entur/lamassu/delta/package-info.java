/**
 * Warning: This feature is experimental and API is subject to change.
 *
 * <p>
 *     This package offers functionality to compare GBFS files of the same type
 *     and create a "delta" representation of the comparison.
 * </p>
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Use cases:
 *     * Simplify the entity cache updater logic for stations and vehicles which
 *       encodes much of the same logic but in a much more complicated way.
 *     * Offer the possibility to subscribe to deltas via a public API, which has
 *       the potential to reduce bandwidth and compute resource usage between
 *       servers and clients
 * </p>
